# Proffera Project Handoff

Project: Proffera
Repository: `ibboabdoli-ai/Proffera`
Stack: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Neon/Postgres.
UI language: Swedish.

## Status

The MVP lead flow is working.

Completed:

- Phase 07: Company registration
- Phase 08: Matching companies to leads
- Phase 10: Manual lead sending with mailto
- Phase 11: Outbox / delivery log
- Phase 11.1: Duplicate prevention for outbox logs
- Phase 12: Company approval and improved matching score
- Phase 12.1: Project memory system

## Safe points

Before Phase 12:

`4ed3e4feddc427a110df48104db910c3633fb692`

Safe point after Phase 12:

`d8bab25913c1c9b8dd60f77d48d2e88b16be28bd`

Current project-memory safe point:

`99ecefd8d980013caeb562d218efcd478e380964`

## Project memory files

Read these files before starting new work:

- `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## Main admin routes

- `/admin`
- `/admin/status`
- `/admin/foretag`
- `/admin/foretag/hantera`
- `/admin/matchning`
- `/admin/skicka-lead`
- `/admin/leverans`

## Tested flow

A quote request was matched to one approved company.

The company was updated from a generic service value to real services:

`Fönsterputs, Lägenhet, Hemstädning, Flyttstädning`

The matching score reached `115` with these reasons:

`område, kategori, tjänst, godkänt företag`

The outbox log flow was tested. Duplicate prevention works and the UI shows one latest log per lead/company pair.

## Database tables currently used

- `quote_requests`
- `company_registrations`
- `lead_outbox`

## Important notes

- Use Neon/Postgres, not Supabase.
- Keep changes small.
- Keep rollback points before each phase.
- Avoid unnecessary Vercel deploys.
- Do not expose environment variable values.
- Some long documentation or migration payloads may be blocked by safety checks; do not retry blocked payloads repeatedly.

## Next recommended phase

Phase 13: Admin cleanup.

Suggested goals:

1. Add clearer admin navigation.
2. Make `/admin` the central dashboard.
3. Link requests, companies, company management, matching, sending and delivery log.
4. Improve workflow labels.
5. Keep the UI minimal but clearer.

After that: Phase 14, real email provider integration.
